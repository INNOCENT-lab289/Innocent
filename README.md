# Project Title  
**Innocent: An AI-Powered Leadership Support Tool**

## Summary  
Innocent is an AI-based leadership support tool designed to help leaders make ethical, inclusive, and data-informed decisions. The project focuses on using AI to analyze leadership challenges and suggest fair, transparent, and people-centered solutions in organizational settings.

## Background  
Leadership decisions often affect many people, yet they are sometimes made with limited information, bias, or emotional pressure. This project aims to support leaders by providing AI-driven insights that promote ethical leadership, accountability, and better communication.

The idea addresses the following problems:
- Poor decision-making due to bias or lack of data  
- Miscommunication between leaders and teams  
- Ethical challenges in leadership roles  
- Limited access to leadership coaching and feedback  

These problems are very common in organizations, especially in fast-growing institutions and workplaces with diverse teams. My personal motivation comes from observing how leadership decisions directly impact employee morale, productivity, and trust. This topic is important because strong, ethical leadership is essential for sustainable growth and positive organizational culture.
