# Innocent: AI-Powered Leadership Decision Support

## Summary  
Innocent is an AI-based leadership support project designed to help leaders make ethical, inclusive, and data-informed decisions. The system analyzes leadership challenges and provides insights that promote transparency, fairness, and effective communication within organizations.

## Background  
Leadership decisions often impact many individuals, yet they are frequently made under pressure, with limited data, or influenced by personal bias. This project aims to reduce these challenges by using AI to support leaders with objective insights and ethical guidance.

The project addresses the following problems:
- Biased or emotionally driven leadership decisions  
- Poor communication between leaders and team members  
- Ethical dilemmas in organizational leadership  
- Limited access to leadership coaching and feedback  

These issues are common in many organizations, especially in workplaces with diverse teams and rapid growth. My personal motivation comes from observing how leadership quality directly affects trust, productivity, and morale. This topic is important because ethical and informed leadership is essential for sustainable organizational success.

## Version Control and Collaboration  
When you perform a **commit**, you are saving the current state of the project repository. This allows you to go back in history, review changes made to project files, and reset the project to a previous state if needed. When collaborating with others, this is an essential feature that helps track contributions and avoid conflicts.
